                <p class="catalog-p-2"> Interior Painting & Exterior Painting</p>
                <p class="catalog-pp-2">Studies have shown that painting the exterior of a house and the interior walls
                    and trim increases
                    the overall value of your property. It helps with resale, as well, by adding a fresh look outside
                    and inside.
                    A fresh coat of paint on the exterior of a home makes it more attractive—called curb appeal.
                    You and your family can have healthier indoor air by painting interior walls and other surfaces with
                    zero-VOC or low VOC finishes and paints.
                    It will also reduce fumes and odors. Keeping a good coat of quality paint on the exterior of the
                    home will help protect it from the weather,
                    particularly moisture from rain and snow. Painting requires less money when compared to the cost of
                    repairing damage to your stucco, water intrusion repairs,
                    rot, and the possibility of mold. Extreme rot can even diminish the structural integrity of your
                    home leading to further costly issues.
                    Painting the interior surfaces will help to resist wear and tear and protect walls and trim from
                    moisture. Painting the walls is a simple and cost-effective way
                    to protect your home from damage due to rot or even mold.</p>

                <p class="catalog-pp">Real Estate Agents confirm that a paved driveway adds value to a home over a
                    standard concrete or asphalt driveway. Resistance to root growth, erosion, earthquake and frost.
                    Pavers are designed to undulate with movement and will not crack.
                    They allow for easy access to roots, making maintenance a snap! In contrast to non-permeable
                    materials,
                    paving stones allow natural biological processes to filter run-off before it pollutes our creeks.
                    The paving stones allow water to drain through, and beneficial bacteria, which live between the
                    stones and in the gravel bed below,
                    remove toxins before they reach our creeks, the bay and our beaches.</p>

                <p class="catalog-pp-2"> Concrete paving slabs are one of the most common parts of modern surroundings
                    nowadays.
                    From roads, and parks to driveways, these pavers exist around us. Though other materials are also
                    available
                    for pavers concrete is the most popular material for several reasons. Homeowners are very much
                    interested in
                    concrete paver patios to improve their outdoor living spaces. Paver patios offer a stylish and
                    peaceful area that’s perfect for
                    both alone time and hosting gatherings. They’re made up of individual concrete pavers that connect
                    to form a seamless surface.
                    Durability is the key feature of the concrete paving slabs. These paving slabs are papular for their
                    exceptional durability.
                    Unlike other materials, they can withstand heavy loads and adverse weather conditions. This makes
                    them suitable for driveway pavers,
                    Exterior slabs, and flooring. You don’t have to have some spare time for these slabs. Because low
                    maintenance is their significant advantage,
                    there shouldn’t be any significant maintenance program for them. Regular sweeping and occasional
                    washing keep these concrete look pavers looking new,
                    reducing the time and effort needed for upkeep. </p>
